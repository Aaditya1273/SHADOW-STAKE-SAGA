- ✅ **No cheating** - All scores are validated by smart contracts

### 🏆 **Transparent Leaderboards**
- **Real-time rankings** fetched directly from blockchain events
- **No fake scores** - Every score is backed by a blockchain transaction
- **Global competition** - Compete with players worldwide on a trustless platform
- **Historical data** - View complete game history for any player

### 💰 **Play-to-Earn Potential**
- Scores stored on-chain can be used for future token rewards
- **$SSS Token integration** ready for minting based on performance

- NFT achievements for milestone completions

### 🔐 **Security & Trust**
- **Smart contracts** handle all game logic validation
